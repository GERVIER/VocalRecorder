                <p id="explication">
                    "Vocal Recoder" is a demonstrator for the LIUM (Laboratoire d' Informatique de l' Universit√© du Mans) to present to the general public their research in the field of speech recognition. 
                    These new technologies are presented to you in playful form. The original idea is to compare a voice timbre (which could be yours) with that of world-famous personalities (Obama, Macron, 
                    Ronaldo, Michael Jackson, Pope Francis, etc).

                    To do this, the demonstrator is composed of two interfaces: On the first interface, you can choose between one to five personalities. These different people will then be used during the 
                    demonstration test. On the second interface, this time you will have the opportunity to record your own voice, or use an existing audio file, to enjoy the developed speech recognition 
                    technology. This small vocal mimetic game will tell you the personality whose voice timbre is closest to yours or the one present in the audio file.
